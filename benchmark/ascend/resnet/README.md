# [ResNet Description](#contents)

## Description

ResNet (residual neural network) was proposed by Kaiming He and other four Chinese of Microsoft Research Institute. Through the use of ResNet unit, it successfully trained 152 layers of neural network, and won the championship in ilsvrc2015. The error rate on top 5 was 3.57%, and the parameter quantity was lower than vggnet, so the effect was very outstanding. Traditional convolution network or full connection network will have more or less information loss. At the same time, it will lead to the disappearance or explosion of gradient, which leads to the failure of deep network training. ResNet solves this problem to a certain extent. By passing the input information to the output, the integrity of the information is protected. The whole network only needs to learn the part of the difference between input and output, which simplifies the learning objectives and difficulties.The structure of ResNet can accelerate the training of neural network very quickly, and the accuracy of the model is also greatly improved. At the same time, ResNet is very popular, even can be directly used in the concept net network.

These are examples of training ResNet18/ResNet50/ResNet101/ResNet152/SE-ResNet50 with CIFAR-10/ImageNet2012 dataset in MindSpore.ResNet50 and ResNet101 can reference [paper 1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) below, and SE-ResNet50 is a variant of ResNet50 which reference  [paper 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507) and [paper 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187) below, Training SE-ResNet50 for just 24 epochs using 8 Ascend 910, we can reach top-1 accuracy of 75.9%.(Training ResNet101 with dataset CIFAR-10 and SE-ResNet50 with CIFAR-10 is not supported yet.)

# [Features](#contents)

## Mixed Precision

The [mixed precision](https://mindspore.cn/tutorials/en/master/advanced/mixed_precision.html) training method accelerates the deep learning neural network training process by using both the single-precision and half-precision data types, and maintains the network precision achieved by the single-precision training at the same time. Mixed precision training can accelerate the computation process, reduce memory usage, and enable a larger model or batch size to be trained on specific hardware.
For FP16 operators, if the input data type is FP32, the backend of MindSpore will automatically handle it with reduced precision. Users could check the reduced-precision operators by enabling INFO log and then searching ‘reduce precision’.

## [Training Process](#contents)

### Usage

#### Running on Ascend

```bash
# distributed training
Usage: bash run_distribute_train.sh [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [PRETRAINED_CKPT_PATH](optional)

# standalone training
Usage: bash run_standalone_train.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [PRETRAINED_CKPT_PATH](optional)

# run evaluation example
Usage: bash run_eval.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CHECKPOINT_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH]
```

For distributed training, a hccl configuration file with JSON format needs to be created in advance.

Please follow the instructions in the link [hccn_tools](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/r2.0/utils/hccl_tools).

Training result will be stored in the example path, whose folder name begins with "train" or "train_parallel". Under this, you can find checkpoint file together with result like the following in log.

If you want to change device_id for standalone training, you can set environment variable `export DEVICE_ID=x` or set `device_id=x` in context.

#### Evaluation while training

```bash
# evaluation with distributed training Ascend example:
bash run_distribute_train.sh [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RUN_EVAL](optional) [EVAL_DATASET_PATH](optional)

# evaluation with standalone training Ascend example:
bash run_standalone_train.sh [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RUN_EVAL](optional) [EVAL_DATASET_PATH](optional)

# evaluation with distributed training GPU example:
bash run_distribute_train_gpu.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RUN_EVAL](optional) [EVAL_DATASET_PATH](optional)

# evaluation with standalone training GPU example:
bash run_standalone_train_gpu.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RUN_EVAL](optional) [EVAL_DATASET_PATH](optional)
```

`RUN_EVAL` and `EVAL_DATASET_PATH` are optional arguments, setting `RUN_EVAL`=True allows you to do evaluation while training. When `RUN_EVAL` is set, `EVAL_DATASET_PATH` must also be set.
And you can also set these optional arguments: `save_best_ckpt`, `eval_start_epoch`, `eval_interval` for python script when `RUN_EVAL` is True.

By default, a standalone cache server would be started to cache all eval images in tensor format in memory to improve the evaluation performance. Please make sure the dataset fits in memory (Around 30GB of memory required for ImageNet2012 eval dataset, 6GB of memory required for CIFAR-10 eval dataset).

Users can choose to shutdown the cache server after training or leave it alone for future usage.

Current batch_Size can only be set to 1.

```shell
# Ascend310 inference

# [Description of Random Situation](#contents)

In dataset.py, we set the seed inside “create_dataset" function. We also use random seed in train.py.

# FAQ

Refer to the [ModelZoo FAQ](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models#FAQ) for some common question.

- **Q: How to use `boost` to get the best performance?**

  **A**: We provide the `boost_level` in the `Model` interface, when you set it to `O1` or `O2` mode, the network will automatically speed up. The high-performance mode has been fully verified on resnet50, you can use the `resnet50_imagenet2012_Boost_config.yaml` to experience this mode. Meanwhile, in `O1` or `O2` mode, it is recommended to set the following environment variables: ` export ENV_FUSION_CLEAR=1; export DATASET_ENABLE_NUMA=True; export ENV_SINGLE_EVAL=1; export SKT_ENABLE=1;`.
