import numpy as np


class MultiStepLR:
    """
    Multi-step learning rate scheduler

    Decays the learning rate by gamma once the number of epoch reaches one of the milestones.

    Args:
        lr (float): Initial learning rate which is the lower boundary in the cycle.
        milestones (list): List of epoch indices. Must be increasing.
        gamma (float): Multiplicative factor of learning rate decay.
        steps_per_epoch (int): The number of steps per epoch to train for.
        max_epoch (int): The number of epochs to train for.
        warmup_epochs (int, optional): The number of epochs to Warmup. Default: 0

    Outputs:
        numpy.ndarray, shape=(1, steps_per_epoch*max_epoch)

    Example:
        >>> # Assuming optimizer uses lr = 0.05 for all groups
        >>> # lr = 0.05     if epoch < 30
        >>> # lr = 0.005    if 30 <= epoch < 80
        >>> # lr = 0.0005   if epoch >= 80
        >>> scheduler = MultiStepLR(lr=0.1, milestones=[30,80], gamma=0.1, steps_per_epoch=5000, max_epoch=90)
        >>> lr = scheduler.get_lr()
