# [DeepSpeech2 Description](#contents)

DeepSpeech2 is a speech recognition models which is trained with CTC loss. It replaces entire pipelines of hand-engineered components with neural networks and can handle a diverse variety of speech including noisy
environments, accents and different languages. We support training and evaluation on CPU and GPU.

[Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.02595v1.pdf): Amodei, Dario, et al. Deep speech 2: End-to-end speech recognition in english and mandarin.

# [Model Architecture](#contents)

The current reproduced model consists of:

- two convolutional layers:
    - number of channels is 32, kernel size is [41, 11], stride is [2, 2]
    - number of channels is 32, kernel size is [41, 11], stride is [2, 1]
- five bidirectional LSTM layers (size is 1024)
- one projection layer (size is number of characters plus 1 for CTC blank symbol, 29)

# [Training and Eval process](#contents)

Before training, the dataset should be processed. We use the scripts provided by [SeanNaren](https://github.com/SeanNaren/deepspeech.pytorch/tree/V2.1) to process the dataset.
This script in [SeanNaren](https://github.com/SeanNaren/deepspeech.pytorch/tree/V2.1) will automatically download the dataset and process it. After the process, the
dataset directory structure is as follows:

```path
    .
    ├─ LibriSpeech_dataset
    │  ├── train
    │  │   ├─ wav
    │  │   └─ txt
    │  ├── val
    │  │    ├─ wav
    │  │    └─ txt
    │  ├── test_clean  
    │  │    ├─ wav
    │  │    └─ txt  
    │  └── test_other
    │       ├─ wav
    │       └─ txt
    └─ libri_test_clean_manifest.csv, libri_test_other_manifest.csv, libri_train_manifest.csv, libri_val_manifest.csv
```

The three *.csv file stores the absolute path of the corresponding
data. After obtaining the 3 csv file, you should modify the configurations in `src/config.py`.
For training config, the train_manifest should be configured with the path of `libri_train_manifest.csv` and for eval config, it should be configured
with `libri_test_other_manifest.csv` or `libri_train_manifest.csv`, depending on which dataset is evaluated.

```shell
...
for training configuration
"DataConfig":{
     train_manifest:'path_to_csv/libri_train_manifest.csv'
}

for evaluation configuration
"DataConfig":{
     train_manifest:'path_to_csv/libri_test_clean_manifest.csv'
}

```

Before training, some requirements should be installed, including `librosa` and `Levenshtein`
After installing MindSpore via the official website and finishing dataset processing, you can start training as follows:

```shell

# standalone training gpu
bash ./scripts/run_standalone_train_gpu.sh [DEVICE_ID]

# standalone training cpu
bash ./scripts/run_standalone_train_cpu.sh

# distributed training gpu
bash ./scripts/run_distribute_train_gpu.sh

```

The following script is used to evaluate the model. Note we only support greedy decoder now and before run the script,
you should download the decoder code from [SeanNaren](https://github.com/SeanNaren/deepspeech.pytorch/tree/V2.1) and place
deepspeech_pytorch into deepspeech2 directory. After that, the file directory will be displayed as that in [Script and Sample Code]

```shell

# eval on cpu
bash ./scripts/run_eval_cpu.sh [PATH_CHECKPOINT]

# eval on gpu
bash ./scripts/run_eval_gpu.sh [DEVICE_ID] [PATH_CHECKPOINT]

```

## [Export MindIR](#contents)

```bash
python export.py --pre_trained_model_path='ckpt_path'
```

# Quick Start

Before running, put the audio files and data into the quickstart folder, store their paths in the csv file, and set the path in the qs_config.py file. Run the following code.

```bash
python quick_start.py --pretrain_ckpt=[PRETRAINED_BACKBONE]
# example: python quick_start.py --pretrain_ckpt=./checkpoint/ckpt_0/DeepSpeech0-70_1287.ckpt
```
