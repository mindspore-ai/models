# [ResNet Description](#contents)

## Description

ResNet (residual neural network) was proposed by Kaiming He and other four Chinese of Microsoft Research Institute. Through the use of ResNet unit, it successfully trained 152 layers of neural network, and won the championship in ilsvrc2015. The error rate on top 5 was 3.57%, and the parameter quantity was lower than vggnet, so the effect was very outstanding. Traditional convolution network or full connection network will have more or less information loss. At the same time, it will lead to the disappearance or explosion of gradient, which leads to the failure of deep network training. ResNet solves this problem to a certain extent. By passing the input information to the output, the integrity of the information is protected. The whole network only needs to learn the part of the difference between input and output, which simplifies the learning objectives and difficulties.The structure of ResNet can accelerate the training of neural network very quickly, and the accuracy of the model is also greatly improved. At the same time, ResNet is very popular, even can be directly used in the concept net network.

These are examples of training ResNet18/ResNet50/ResNet101/ResNet152/SE-ResNet50 with CIFAR-10/ImageNet2012 dataset in MindSpore.ResNet50 and ResNet101 can reference [paper 1](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.03385.pdf) below, and SE-ResNet50 is a variant of ResNet50 which reference  [paper 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.01507) and [paper 3](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.01187) below, Training SE-ResNet50 for just 24 epochs using 8 Ascend 910, we can reach top-1 accuracy of 75.9%.(Training ResNet101 with dataset CIFAR-10 and SE-ResNet50 with CIFAR-10 is not supported yet.)

# [Features](#contents)

## Mixed Precision

The [mixed precision](https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorials/en/master/advanced/mixed_precision.html) training method accelerates the deep learning neural network training process by using both the single-precision and half-precision data types, and maintains the network precision achieved by the single-precision training at the same time. Mixed precision training can accelerate the computation process, reduce memory usage, and enable a larger model or batch size to be trained on specific hardware.
For FP16 operators, if the input data type is FP32, the backend of MindSpore will automatically handle it with reduced precision. Users could check the reduced-precision operators by enabling INFO log and then searching ‘reduce precision’.

## [Training Process](#contents)

### Usage

#### Running on Ascend

```bash
# distributed training
Usage: bash run_distribute_train.sh [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RESUME_CKPT](optional)

# standalone training
Usage: bash run_standalone_train.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RESUME_CKPT](optional)

# run evaluation example
Usage: bash run_eval.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CHECKPOINT_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH]
```

For distributed training, a hccl configuration file with JSON format needs to be created in advance.

Please follow the instructions in the link [hccn_tools](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/tree/master/utils/hccl_tools).

Training result will be stored in the example path, whose folder name begins with "train" or "train_parallel". Under this, you can find checkpoint file together with result like the following in log.

If you want to change device_id for standalone training, you can set environment variable `export DEVICE_ID=x` or set `device_id=x` in context.

#### Running on GPU

```bash
# distributed training example
bash run_distribute_train_gpu.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RESUME_CKPT](optional)

# standalone training example
bash run_standalone_train_gpu.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RESUME_CKPT](optional)

# infer example
bash run_eval_gpu.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CHECKPOINT_PATH]
[CONFIG_PATH]

# gpu benchmark training example
bash run_gpu_resnet_benchmark.sh [DATASET_PATH] [BATCH_SIZE](optional) [DTYPE](optional) [DEVICE_NUM](optional) [SAVE_CKPT](optional) [SAVE_PATH](optional)

# gpu benchmark infer example
bash run_eval_gpu_resnet_benchmark.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CKPT_PATH] [BATCH_SIZE](optional) [DTYPE](optional)
```

For distributed training, a hostfile configuration needs to be created in advance.

Please follow the instructions in the link [GPU-Multi-Host](https://www.mindspore.cn/tutorials/experts/en/master/parallel/train_gpu.html).

#### Running parameter server mode training

- Parameter server training Ascend example

```bash
bash run_parameter_server_train.sh [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RESUME_CKPT](optional)
```

- Parameter server training GPU example

```bash
bash run_parameter_server_train_gpu.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RESUME_CKPT](optional)
```

#### Evaluation while training

```bash
# evaluation with distributed training Ascend example:
cd scripts/
bash run_distribute_train.sh [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RUN_EVAL] [EVAL_DATASET_PATH]

# example of reasoning during distributed breakpoint training:
cd scripts/
bash run_distribute_train.sh [RANK_TABLE_FILE] [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RUN_EVAL] [EVAL_DATASET_PATH] [RESUME_CKPT]

# evaluation with standalone training Ascend example:
cd scripts/
bash run_standalone_train.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RUN_EVAL] [EVAL_DATASET_PATH]

# example of reasoning during single machine breakpoint training:
cd scripts/
bash run_standalone_train.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RUN_EVAL] [EVAL_DATASET_PATH] [RESUME_CKPT]

# evaluation with distributed training GPU example:
cd scripts/
bash run_distribute_train_gpu.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RUN_EVAL] [EVAL_DATASET_PATH]

# evaluation with standalone training GPU example:
cd scripts/
bash run_standalone_train_gpu.sh [DATASET_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [RUN_EVAL] [EVAL_DATASET_PATH]
```

`RUN_EVAL` and `EVAL_DATASET_PATH` are optional arguments, setting `RUN_EVAL`=True allows you to do evaluation while training. When `RUN_EVAL` is set, `EVAL_DATASET_PATH` must also be set.
And you can also set these optional arguments: `save_best_ckpt`, `eval_start_epoch`, `eval_interval` for python script when `RUN_EVAL` is True.

By default, a standalone cache server would be started to cache all eval images in tensor format in memory to improve the evaluation performance. Please make sure the dataset fits in memory (Around 30GB of memory required for ImageNet2012 eval dataset, 6GB of memory required for CIFAR-10 eval dataset).

Users can choose to shutdown the cache server after training or leave it alone for future usage.

## [Prediction Process](#contents)

### Prediction

Before running the command below, please check the checkpoint path and image path used for prediction.

```bash
python predict.py --checkpoint_file_path [CKPT_PATH] --config_path [CONFIG_PATH] --img_path [IMG_PATH] > log.txt 2>&1 &  
```

for example:

```bash
python predict.py --checkpoint_file_path train_parallel0/resnet-90_625.ckpt --config_path config/resnet18_imagenet2012_config_gpu.yaml --img_path test.png > log.txt 2>&1 &  
```

You can view the results through the file "log.txt". The prediction res and averaget prediction time will be logged:

```bash
Prediction res: 5
Prediction avg time: 5.360 ms
```

If you want to predict by inference backend MindSpore Lite, you can directly set parameter `backend` to 'lite', which is an experimental feature, the corresponding running example is shown as follows:

```bash
python predict.py --checkpoint_file_path [CKPT_PATH] --config_path [CONFIG_PATH] --img_path [IMG_PATH] --enable_predict_lite_backend True > log.txt 2>&1 &  
```

Or you can predict by using MindSpore Lite Python interface, which is shown as follows, please refer to [Using Python Interface to Perform Cloud-side Inference](https://www.mindspore.cn/lite/docs/en/master/use/cloud_infer/runtime_python.html) for details.

```bash
python predict.py --mindir_path [MINDIR_PATH] --config_path [CONFIG_PATH] --img_path [IMG_PATH] --enable_predict_lite_mindir True > log.txt 2>&1 &  
```

## Inference Process

**Before inference, please refer to [MindSpore Inference with C++ Deployment Guide](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models/blob/master/utils/cpp_infer/README.md) to set environment variables.**

### Infer on Ascend310

Before performing inference, the mindir file must bu exported by `export.py` script. We only provide an example of inference using MINDIR model.
Current batch_Size can only be set to 1.

```shell
# Ascend310 inference
bash run_infer_310.sh [MINDIR_PATH] [NET_TYPE] [DATASET]  [DATA_PATH] [CONFIG_PATH] [DEVICE_ID]
```

- `NET_TYPE` can choose from [resnet18, se-resnet50, resnet34, resnet50, resnet101, resnet152].
- `DATASET` can choose from [cifar10, imagenet].
- `DEVICE_ID` is optional, default value is 0.

# Apply algorithm in MindSpore Golden Stick

MindSpore Golden Stick is a compression algorithm set for MindSpore. We usually apply algorithm in Golden Stick before training for smaller model size, lower power consuming or faster inference process.

MindSpore Golden Stick provides SimQAT and SCOP algorithm for ResNet50. SimQAT is a quantization-aware training algorithm that trains the quantization parameters of certain layers in the network by introducing fake-quantization nodes, so that the model can perform inference with less power consumption or higher performance during the deployment phase. SCOP algorithm is a reliable pruning algorithm, which reduces the influence of all potential irrelevant factors by constructing a scientific control mechanism, and effectively deletes nodes in proportion, thereby realizing the miniaturization of the model.

MindSpore Golden Stick provides SLB algorithm for ResNet18. SLB is provided by Huawei Noah's Ark Lab. SLB is a quantization algorithm with low-bit weight searching, it regards the discrete weights in an arbitrary quantized neural network as searchable variables, and utilize a differential method to search them accurately. In particular, each weight is represented as a probability distribution over the discrete value set. The probabilities are optimized during training and the values with the highest probability are selected to establish the desired quantized network. SLB have more advantage when quantize with low-bit compared with SimQAT.

MindSpore Golden Stick provides UniPruning algorithm for ResNet18/34/50/101/152 and other ResNet-like and VGG-like models.  UniPruning is provided by Intelligent Systems and Data Science Technology center of Huawei Moscow Research Center. UniPruning is a soft-pruning algorithm. It measures relative importance of channels in a hardware-friendly manner. Particularly, it groups channels in groups of size G, where each channel's importance is measured as a L2 norm of its weights multiplied by consecutive BatchNorm's gamma and the absolute group importance is given as the median of channel importances. The relative importance criteria of a channel group G group of a layer L is measured as the highest median of the layer L divided by the median of group G. The higher the relative importance of a group, the less a group contributes to the layer output. During training UniPruning algorithm every N epochs searches for channel groups with the highest relative criteria network-wise and zeroes channels in that groups until reaching target sparsity, which is gives as a % of parameters to prune. To obtain pruned model after training, pruning mask and zeroed weights from the last UniPruning step are used to physically prune the network.

## Training Process

| **Algorithm**  | SimQAT | SCOP | SLB | UniPruning |
| --------- | ------ | --- | ---- | ---- |
| **supported backend**  | GPU | GPU、Ascend | GPU | GPU, Ascend |
| **support pretrain** | yes | must provide pretrained ckpt | don't need and can't load pretrained ckpt | pretrained ckpt optional |
| **support continue-train** | yes | yes | yes | yes |
| **support distribute train** | yes | yes | yes | yes |

- `pretrain` means training the network without applying algorithm. `pretrained ckpt` is loaded when training network with algorithm applied.
- `continue-train` means stop the training process after applying algorithm and continue training process from checkpoint file of previous training process.

# FAQ

Refer to the [ModelZoo FAQ](https://gitee.com/mindspore/models#FAQ) for some common question.

- **Q: How to use `boost` to get the best performance?**

  **A**: We provide the `boost_level` in the `Model` interface, when you set it to `O1` or `O2` mode, the network will automatically speed up. The high-performance mode has been fully verified on resnet50, you can use the `resnet50_imagenet2012_Boost_config.yaml` to experience this mode. Meanwhile, in `O1` or `O2` mode, it is recommended to set the following environment variables: ` export ENV_FUSION_CLEAR=1; export DATASET_ENABLE_NUMA=True; export ENV_SINGLE_EVAL=1; export SKT_ENABLE=1;`.
